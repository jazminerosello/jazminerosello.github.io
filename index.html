                        <p> I still do not have my favorite CMSC subject so far.
                            I'm still looking for the subject â€ hat will meet my interest and passion. <br /> <br />

                            <p> My favorite GE so far is STS 1 because I had fun doing the tasks in tht subject. 
                                It actually awoke my creativity in making those tasks. <br /> <br />

                            <p> My favorite programming language so far is python language because I realized that it
                                is actually kind of easy since the syntax is just an english sentence if you would notice. <br /> <br />
